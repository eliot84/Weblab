	    Use Media Queries to style different view sizes differently. We are going to show and hide 3 different images based on the size of the browser window. 


	CONTENT GATHERING
	    - Collect 3 different images of a specific animal

      Create a new folder inside of your project folder and call it "images"
	  Use the startup HTML code provided below


	CODE
      Make 3 box's using divs in the html and give each div a specific ID name
      Give each box a specific height and widtd no bigger than 300px by 300px
      Give each div a background image using CSS styling
      Add media queries for small displays, medium displays and large displays

	  Using Media Queries perform the following: 
	      Box 1 should show only when the small view is available
	      Box 2 should show only when the middle view is available
	      Box 3 should show only when the large view is available
