THE MIAMI CITIES CHALLENGE!!!
Assignment 4 Content Gathering/Research


     For your next assignment, you have been hired by Miami-Dade county to create awareness for a Miami based city, village or town of your choice.


     To begin code on this assignment you will first need to do some research:

     Pick a City, Village or Town (CVT):
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communities_in_Miami-Dade_County,_Florida

     Pick a color scheme you would like to use for your website (and remember to stick to it).

     Perform content research for your website. A good example of items to look for are:

     - Current population
     - Average Household Income
     - Picture of the CVT
     - 4 distinct features of the CVT
     - 1 Major feature or news about the CVT
     - 10 - 15 Pictures related to the goal of the site, the potential for the CVT or any of the features described.


     Wireframe a potential homepage. You will need to do 3 drawings (Small, medium and large sizes)

     No Need to Start Coding. Coding specs will be provided after spring break and you will be working on the assignment in and out of class :-)
