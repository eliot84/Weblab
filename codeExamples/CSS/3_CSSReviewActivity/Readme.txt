Code: Add CSS
     - For prototyping purposes, use a style tag (open and close) in your index.html so you can begin targetting elements and 
       giving them  
       properties (no need to use the style tag when using an external style sheet)
     - Title your webpage in the head section and also add a title using an h1 tag in the body
     - Add an underline and a background color to all h2 tags
     - Add a class to each p tag make sure each one gets a different class name
     - target the content in the first p tag and make the text a specific color(use rgb code), font and move it to the right 
       with a margin.
     - do the same for the other 2 tags and make sure that each p tag has different font, color and margins
     - Add a background color to the entire page (use a hex code specifically for this
     - Add a margin between the 2nd h2 tags and the 3rd p tag of 200px (pixels)
