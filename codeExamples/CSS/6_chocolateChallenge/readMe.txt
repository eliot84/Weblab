THE CHOCOLATE CHALLENGE

Pair Programming: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q

     Congratulations you and your team have just received a 50% deposit on a new website redesign for a highly confidential client that specializes in chocolate. The client needs the project completed ASAP. You will use pair programming to help expedite the project.

     Step 1: Pick a Team Name (1 Minute)

             Choose a driver for your team. A driver is the person actually coding while the others assist by telling the driver what to code specifically. This is a great role for someone who doesn't feel comfortable coding, because the driver focuses on learning while coding while team-mates make code decisions. 

             If the driver gets tired and/or another teammate wishes to drive you may swap roles. The driver simply zip's up the folder colding the code project and can slack it to his/her teammates. 

             DRIVERS! MAKE SURE TO SHARE YOUR CODE REGULARLY (especially end of class) THROUGH SLACK AND ADD COMMENTS/NOTES. 

             Bonus for anyone that adds the project on github after its done, make sure to give your teammates credit in the readme file (link to their github links)

             Hint: when working on a web project the process is always: content gathering, Html structure with content, Add CSS. Make sure to follow this workflow to streamline the process.
