    <!-- There are 2 ways to attach javascript code to your webpages. Inline javascript through script tags as below, and through an external js file usually attached towards the bottom of the body. -->


  <!-- Inline JS -->
    <script type="text/javascript">

      //COMMENTING INSIDE OF JAVASCRIPT 

      //Commenting 1 line
      
      /*
          Commenting Multiple Lines
      */

      //document.write prints from javascript to the webpage
        document.write("Welcome, this is an Intro to Javascript");


      //Console.log prints out code results to the console of a web browser. This is very helpful for testing and debugging our JS programs. The semi colon is important syntax. It declares the end of a code statement.
      console.log("HELLO from the inline world!! :-)");


    </script>

    <!-- External JS --> 
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/welcome.js"></script>
