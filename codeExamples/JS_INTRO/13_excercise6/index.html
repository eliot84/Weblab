      ### Instructions

* Write code that loops through the following array and logs the name of each animal on the farm to the console:

```
Create an array that holds a list of farm animals
Create a variable that holds the number length of the array
Use a for loop to scan through the array
only display array items that start with a "c", "o", "p"
also pick a random animal to display regardless of the above rule

``
* **HINT:** You can access the first character of a string as if it were the first element of an array using the .chartAt() method.
